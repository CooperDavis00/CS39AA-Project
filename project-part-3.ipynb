Introduction/Background\n","\n","For project part three  I will be using a couple different song datasets that contain the song title, the artist,  the genre(s) of the song, and I will add some different song attributes to each song. I will also be using my own dataset with my personal spotify data of liked songs, this time also using the same song attributes. This personal dataset will have the same parameters along with a parameter that will say 1 or 0 if I like the song or do not.Initially the liked songs dataset will have a like value of 1 and the other dataset i have not seen will all have like values of 0. Instead of changing those values i am going to add another column called \"like prediction' that will change based on if the song genre and attributes match my own tase in music. All in all, I am using song data to predict if I would like a song based on my own liked songs"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"editable":false,"papermill":{"duration":0.00486,"end_time":"2023-11-13T05:57:02.755316","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-11-13T05:57:02.750456","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 2.
